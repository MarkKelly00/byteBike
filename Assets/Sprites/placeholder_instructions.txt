=== SPRITE IMPORT SETTINGS ===

For ALL sprites in Unity:
1. Set Sprite Mode: Single
2. Set Pixels Per Unit: 16
3. Set Filter Mode: Point (no filter)
4. Set Compression: None
5. Set Max Size: 32 (for small sprites)
6. Ensure "Generate Mip Maps" is unchecked

=== QUICK CREATION TIPS ===

- Use any pixel art tool (Aseprite, Photoshop, GIMP, MS Paint)
- Keep it simple - solid colors work fine for placeholders
- Ensure transparent backgrounds (PNG format)
- Make them pixel-perfect at the specified sizes
- Use high contrast colors for visibility

=== AUDIO PLACEHOLDERS ===

You'll also need these audio files:
- RetroLoop.mp3 (any 4-bar chiptune loop)
- Jump.wav (short blip sound)
- Boost.wav (whoosh or power-up sound)
- HitMud.wav (squelch or thud)
- Pickup.wav (coin or ding sound)

Place audio files in:
- Music: Assets/Audio/Music/
- SFX: Assets/Audio/SFX/

=== GETTING STARTED ===

1. Create these placeholder sprites first
2. Import them into Unity using the settings above
3. Set up your scene with the GameObjects
4. Assign the sprites to the appropriate SpriteRenderer components
5. Test the game mechanics with placeholder art
6. Replace with final art assets later

The game will function fully with simple placeholder sprites - the focus should be on getting the mechanics working first!
